# API GetNeighbor

The API Call `get-neighbor` retrieves the neighbors of one or more [[Connections (Result)|Connections (Result)]].
For each of the input connections, it will find the related objects based on the [[FromId|FromId]] and [[ToId|ToId]]: `input.toid = neighbor.fromid` or `input.toid = neighbor.toid` and if the input is bi-directional, in addition `input.fromid = neighbor.fromid` or `input.fromid = neighbor.toid`. (Unless [[TraceBackward|TraceBackward]] has been supplied, in which case we go back against the direction of the network.)
The input connections themselves are excluded from the result.

If the search parameters are specified as wildcards, many matching records can be retrieved.

If no parameters are provided, the [[Sources|Sources]] (see also [[Role|Role]]) in the network are used as input.

| [[./content/API/Parameters/AssetTableNamePattern\|AssetTableNamePattern]]   | string  | false | Name of the asset table in the NetConConnection table. It may contain wild cards if you want to search more than one table. If this parameter is kept empty (no name and no pattern), it will change the interpretation of the [[AssetId|AssetId]] parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/AssetId (Parameter)\|AssetId (Parameter)]]       | long    | false | The number that matches the AssetId of one or more of the NetConConnections exactly. If AssetTableNameWildCard is empty this parameter will be interpreted as ConnectionId.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/CustomAssetIdPattern\|CustomAssetIdPattern]]     | string  | false | The string that matches the CustomAssetId of one or more of the NetConConnections exactly or by [[wildcard|wildcard]] pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/LabelPattern\|LabelPattern]]                     | string  | false | The string or pattern that matches the Label of the NetConConnection, if this was provided. For example: "circuitbreaker:1234" or "circuitbreaker*" or "123456789-*".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/AssetHierarchyPattern\|AssetHierarchyPattern]]   | string  | false | Comma separated list of AssetHierarchy pairs. Every pair looks like 'name=value', e.g. "substation.id=3". The pairs can be in any order, e.g. "substation.id=3,installation.id=17" is the same as "installation.id=17,substation.id=3". For a match, only one of the items needs to match, so if you search for "installation.id=17, installation.id=21, installation.id=43' this will match the aforementioned List that also contains "substation.id=3". |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/SpecificationPattern\|SpecificationPattern]]     | string  | false | Comma separated list of that identifies the asset's specification information that must be matched. See also [[specification|specification]]. For example '789' or 'id=789' or 'material.id=789,core.id=3'. If enrichment has been applied, also things such as 'core_material=CU' can be used.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/WildCardAsRegex\|WildCardAsRegex]]               | boolean | false | Changes all pattern behavior for all [[Wildcard|Wildcard]] pattern parameters, for this API call only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/MaxResults\|MaxResults]]                         | integer | false | Maximum number of results you want to retrieve, 0 if you want to provide none.This can be used to avoid overflow in the receiving application if very large results are produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/IncludeGeoms\|IncludeGeoms]]                     | boolean | false | If false (default and faster), no geometries are returned. This is much faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/MergeGeoms\|MergeGeoms]]                         | boolean | false | If false (default) no additional geometries are retrieved. If true, one set of geometries is retrieved for all points in the result and one set for the lines (multi curve). This saves a lot of overhead in the result and can be convenient for highlighting in the receiving application.                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/GeomsAsArea\|GeomsAsArea]]                       | boolean | false | If false (default) no area geometry is returned. If true, one area geometry is returned (multi polygon) which is a buffer around all points and lines in a single geometry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/EnrichAssetInformation\|EnrichAssetInformation]] | boolean | false | If true, then the assets in the trace results will be enriched with additional information about the asset, if so specificed in the [configuration](#asset-enrichment). The default is false (much faster).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[./content/API/Parameters/TraceBackward\|TraceBackward]]                   | boolean | false | Normally, the trace follows the direction of the network. For unidirectional connections, that means it goes from [[FromId|FromId]] to [[ToId|ToId]], and the trace retrieves only unidirectional neighbors leading 'to' are retrieved. If TraceBackwards is set to true, the opposite direction is followed, and only unidirectional neighbors leading from [[FromId|FromId]] are retrieved. Typically, you do not need to specify this parameter.                           |

The order of the pairs does not matter. The asset hierarchy can be used to identify or complete parts of the network in a single step and to link to structural information that is not part of the connectivity, but relevant for the network operation.
