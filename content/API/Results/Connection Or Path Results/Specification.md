description: Spec of type information of the asset, that provides relevant characteristics of the asset. E.g. for an electric network this could be the core diameter and impedance, for a gas or water network the diameter and resistance, and for a telecom network the light characteristics. If enrichment information has been configured, a whole range of additional [[specification-enrichment|specification attributes]] can be retrieved.
