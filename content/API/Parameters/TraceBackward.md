title: TraceBackward
description: Normally, the get neighbor follows the path follows the direction of the network. For unidirectional connections, that means it goes from FromId to ToId, and only unidirectional neighbors leading 'to' are retrieved. If TraceBackwards is set to true, the opposite direction is followed, and only unidirectional neighbors leading 'from' are retrieved.

Type of: _boolean_

Normally, the get neighbor follows the path follows the direction of the network. For unidirectional connections, that means it goes from FromId to ToId, and only unidirectional neighbors leading 'to' are retrieved. If TraceBackwards is set to true, the opposite direction is followed, and only unidirectional neighbors leading 'from' are retrieved.
