# It is all about the Network: NetCon

Welcome to the online Spatial Eye NetConÂ© Help site. 
Here you will find information about the why, what and how of reasoning about your network with NetCon.
Also, it provides information on how to install, configure and use NetCon, and its related components such as the [[./API/NetCon API Introduction|TraceAPI]] or Flow Calculation export.

Check out [[./Introduction/Copyright and Usage|Copyright and Usage]].

Currently this site is in English only.
## Introduction
This section provides a short [[./Introduction/Introduction|Introduction]] to the agnostic NetCon model for connectivity (also known as topology) for networks.

## Latest news
